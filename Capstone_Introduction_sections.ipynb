        "\n",
        "A Tale of Two cities, a novel written by Charles Dickens was set in London and Paris takes place during the French Revolution. They were both happening then and now. A lot has changed over the years and we now take a look at how the cities have grown. \n",
        "\n",
        "London and Paris are quite the popular tourist and vacation destinations for people all around the world. They are diverse and multicultural and offer a wide variety of experiences that is sough after. We try to group the neighbourhoods of London and Paris respectively and draw insights to what they look like now.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Business Proposal\n",
        "\n",
        "We try to find out the different neighbourhoods present in London and Paris, we cluster them together and present our findings. \n",
        "\n",
        "The aim is to help tourists choose their destinations depending on the experiences that the neighbourhoods have to offer and what they would want to have. This also helps people make decisions if they are thinking about migrating to London or Paris. Our findings will help make informed decisions and address any concerns they have including the different kinds of cuisines, provision stores and what the city has to offer. \n",

        "# Data Description\n",
        "\n",
        "We require geolocation data for both London and Paris. Postal codes in each city serve as a starting point. Using Postal codes we use can find out the neighbourhoods, boroughs, venues and their venue categories.\n",

        "## London\n",
        "\n",
        "To derive our solution, We scrape our data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London\n",

        "ArcGIS Online enables you to connect people, locations, and data using interactive maps. Work with smart, data-driven styles and intuitive analysis tools that deliver location intelligence. Share your insights with the world or specific groups. \n",

        "\n",
        "We will need data about different venues in different neighbourhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n",
        "\n",
        "After finding the list of neighbourhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighbourhood. For each neighbourhood, we have chosen the radius to be 500 meters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n",

We then present our observations and findings. Using this data, our stakeholders can take the necessary decision.\n",
